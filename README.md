# Google Maps API
For our API challenge we had to get a working API from Goolge Maps. Google provides an easy code that you can use but you need to tweak some code, unless you live in australia. To be able to actually use this code you have to request an API key from Google Maps. Once you got it you add it to this line of code:
```
<script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOURAPIKEY&callback=initMap"></script>
```
